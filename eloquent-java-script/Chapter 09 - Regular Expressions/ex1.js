/*
Exercise 1: Regexp Golf
-----------------------

Code golf is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular program
in as few characters as possible. Similarly, regexp golf is the practice of
writing as tiny a regular expression as possible to match a given pattern, and
only that pattern.

For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether the
given pattern occurs in a string. The regular expression should match only
strings containing the pattern. When your expression works, see whether you can
make it any smaller.

1. car and cat
2/ pop and prop
3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari
4. Any word ending in ious
5. A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
6. A word longer than six letters
7. A word without the letter e (or E)

Refer to the table in the chapter summary for help. Test each solution with a
few test strings.
