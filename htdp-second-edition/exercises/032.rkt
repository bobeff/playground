; applications but also employ cell phones, tablets, and their carsâ€™ information
; control screen. Soon people will use wearable computers in the form of
; intelligent glasses, clothes, and sports gear. In the somewhat more distant
; future, people may come with built-in bio computers that directly interact
; with body functions. Think of ten different forms of events that software
; applications on such computers will have to deal with.
