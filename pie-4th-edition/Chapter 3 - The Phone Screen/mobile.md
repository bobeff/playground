# PROBLEM: How is programming for a mobile device different from programming for a normal computer?

- The power consumption of the application is very important because of battery life.

- Limited network bandwidth.

- Limited storage.

- The APIs of the mobile operating systems are different.

- The UI part is very different because of smaller screens and touch and voice input.

- Additional resources like:

  * GPS location service

  * Accelerometer

  * Contacts database

  The access to those additional resources can be restricted by permissions model.
